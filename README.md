# Raindrops-Model
This project aims to give a realistic model of the random behaviour of rain and the dynamics of the raindrops once they land on a pond. I decided it was an interesting phyisical phenomena where I could exploit some of the knowledge gained thorughout my learning on stochastic processes and differential equations, making a basic computer simulated model.
